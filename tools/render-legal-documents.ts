/**
 * Renders the platform's three legal documents as Markdown, so they can be
 * read and approved without a developer (#1340).
 *
 * The prose in `src/lib/legal-defaults.ts` is template literals assembled by
 * `platformLegalDocument()`, which makes the served text impossible to review
 * in the source file: the bullets, retention rows and whole sections a tenant
 * actually gets depend on its collection surface (#1291), and the rules the
 * prose was written under are stated at the top of that module rather than
 * anywhere a reader would look. Approving a document nobody can read is how
 * `legal-defaults.ts` came to be serving under every default tenant's name
 * with no approval record at all.
 *
 * It calls the same function the public routes call, so what it prints is what
 * is served and it cannot drift. That is the whole reason this exists rather
 * than a copy of the prose committed under docs/ -- a copy is correct on the
 * day it is written and wrong at the next commit.
 *
 * It lives in tools/ rather than scripts/ because scripts/ is gitignored for
 * local-only helpers, and this one is referenced from docs/legal-basis.md.
 *
 *   bun run docs:legal              # every collection surface on: the maximal form
 *   bun run docs:legal --minimal    # every surface off: the shortest a tenant gets
 *   bun run docs:legal > /tmp/legal.md
 *
 * The approval log, and what approving means, are in docs/legal-basis.md.
