-- Clocks for the constituent area's personal data (#1296).
--
-- `retention_policies` transcribes the board's decision of 2026-09-02, which
-- predates epic #1160. Three kinds of personal data the site now collects have
-- no published period and nothing in the nightly purge: an account held by a
-- member of the public (`auth.users`), a claim on a directory record
-- (`person_claims`), and hours a volunteer logs themselves
-- (`volunteer_hour_submissions`).
--
-- Worse than the omission, `portal_accounts` publishes a clock that is wrong
-- for these people. It starts when a role ends, and a constituent holds no role
-- at all -- `docs/spec/access-control.md` is explicit that they have no
-- tenant_memberships row, no permission and no membership -- so read literally
-- the page promises a member of the public that their account is kept forever.
--
-- The periods below are transcribed from
-- `planning/chatter-snow/legal/2026-09-19-constituent-accounts-claims-and-self-logged-hours-retention.md`,
-- which amends the 2026-09-02 record, and from src/lib/retention.ts, which the
-- privacy page renders. All three are proposals pending board approval and all
-- three ship in dry_run, like every rule before them: the nightly job reports
-- real counts and changes nothing until an administrator turns a rule on.
--
-- Rules L and M are ordinary per-tenant rules. Rule N is not, and the second
-- half of this migration exists because of it: an account has no tenant, so it
-- needs a way to ask "is anything at all still pointing at this identity?" --
-- the same question retention_person_is_retained() answers for a person, with
-- a different answer about what counts.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Is anything still pointing at this account?
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The auth.users counterpart of retention_person_is_retained()
-- (20260905090000), and deliberately stricter than it: that one has an
-- allow-list of references the purge may drop, and this one has none. Every
-- reference to an account is either authorship of a row (audit_log.actor_id
-- and ~120 created_by/updated_by columns), a role, a membership or the link to
-- a directory record, and each of those is a reason to keep the identity. So
-- there is nothing to list, and "referenced at all" is the whole test.
--
-- Two exclusions, both about rows that are part of the account rather than
-- records about it:
--
--   * the `auth` schema itself -- sessions, identities, refresh tokens, MFA
--     factors -- which cascade, and which exist for every account that ever
--     signed in.
--   * any other reference declared `on delete cascade`: user_onboarding,
--     user_tenant_selection and the rest are per-account state whose whole
--     meaning is "for this account", and they die with it by their own
--     declaration. user_roles, tenant_memberships and deactivated_users
--     cascade too and would be skipped here -- which is why the candidate
--     query below excludes an account holding any of the three before this
--     function is ever asked. An account with a role is a staff account, and
--     an inactivity clock must not quietly revoke it.
--
-- The walk rather than a hand-written list, for the reason merge_people() and
-- retention_person_is_retained() give: the schema gains actor columns most
-- weeks, and a list would be stale within the month.

-- The accounts rule N may delete: never matched to a record, never given a
-- role, holding no claim, and untouched since the cutoff.
--
-- The cheap column tests are in a materialized CTE so the walk above runs over
-- the handful of rows that survive them rather than over auth.users. The five
-- `not exists` clauses are redundant against the walk for four of the five
-- tables -- they cascade, so the walk skips them -- and that is exactly why
-- they are stated here: an account with a role, a membership, a deactivation
-- record or a directory row is somebody the organization knows, whatever the
-- foreign key's on-delete clause happens to say.
--
-- coalesce(last_sign_in_at, created_at): an account created and never signed
-- into has a null last_sign_in_at, and it is the commonest candidate there is
-- -- somebody who signed up, never confirmed, and never came back.
--
-- The 5000 cap bounds one night's work. A wave of sign-up spam would otherwise
-- make this the longest-running rule in the sweep on the night its clock
-- expires; the remainder is taken by the following nights, and the count on
-- the Data Retention page shows the rule is working through them.

  -- N, part one (#1296). Website accounts, decided and applied once for the

  --
  -- The second rule with nothing to scope, for a stronger reason than rule H's:
  -- an account has no tenant until a claim is approved. Somebody signs up at
  -- /my against whichever host they were on and nothing records which --
  -- deliberately, because #1161 resolves a constituent's tenant from the
  -- request rather than from a membership. There is no tenant whose sweep owns
  -- the row.
  --
  -- Two consequences, both the conservative direction:
  --
  --   * the clock is the SHORTEST any tenant has set, as rule H's is. An
  --     account belongs to a person rather than to an organization, so no
  --     tenant's choice may extend how long another's sign-up is held.
  --   * it enforces only where EVERY active tenant has the rule enforcing. One
  --     organization that has not agreed to the period is a veto, because the
  --     row it would remove is as much the next organization's as its own. A
  --     tenant with no row at all reads as 'off' and vetoes too.
  --
  -- The candidate list is read whatever the modes say, so a dry run reports
  -- real counts. It is read here rather than after the loop, so rules L and M
  -- below have not yet dropped this run's expired claims: an account those
  -- deletions free is deleted by the next night's run, not this one. The same
  -- conservatism rule D2 records, and for the same reason -- reporting the
  -- accounts that are already free is checkable, and simulating the ones a
  -- later rule in the same run would free is not.
  --
  -- In its own exception block, unlike rule H's call, which is bare: this one
  -- deletes from auth.users, where a reference the walk cannot see (an
  -- extension's table, storage.objects.owner) raises 23503. The sweep has to
  -- survive that and report it, which is what v_account_error carries into

    -- write-time half of the two mechanisms in docs/spec/audit.md. The delete
    -- therefore leaves no copy of what the claimant typed anywhere.

    -- It is the moment of the decision for a claim somebody decided, and --
    -- defaulted to created_at and maintained by set_updated_at, which no
    -- client can backdate -- the moment it was sent for one nobody did.
