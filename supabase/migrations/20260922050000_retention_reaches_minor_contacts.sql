-- Retention reaches the accompanying-adult and emergency contacts (#685)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- 20260922040000 added four contact columns to `event_registrations`, and the
-- purge's rule C does not know about them: it strips name, email, phone,
-- notes, instagram_handle, pronouns and person_id three years after an event
-- ends and leaves everything else. Without this, an emergency contact's name
-- and number would outlive every other personal field on the same row, which
-- is the opposite of the ordering anyone would choose -- that contact never
-- visited the site and could not be told anything at the point of collection.
--
-- `party_includes_minor` is deliberately NOT cleared. It joins party_size,
-- checked_in_at, the *_at_event snapshots and the waiver pair: a fact about
-- the party and about an act, not the registrant's personal data. The same
-- call #1319 made -- "a redacted consent record is not a record".
--
-- Two halves, and the second is the one that gets skipped: the four columns
-- are added to rule C's SELECT as well as its UPDATE, so a row whose only
-- remaining personal data is an emergency contact is still picked up on a
-- later run.
--
-- The one-directional column constraint (20260922040000) exists for this
-- update. A biconditional would make the purge raise 23514 on every row whose
-- party included a minor, inside a block whose own `exception when others`
-- swallows it into a skipped log row -- event registrations would then never
-- anonymize again.
--
-- `audited_tables` still has no row for event_registrations (20260922000000
-- says why), so `redacted_columns` does not arise. If one is ever added, these
-- four belong in it in the same commit: they are the "never record this" class
-- rather than the "record it and clear it on a clock" class.
--
-- The body is the live one from 20260922010000 -- which added rule O for
-- `person_screenings` (#1360) -- with those two edits and nothing else. This
-- file and that one were written on the same day against the same base, so
-- re-emitting from 20260919040000, the version this was first drafted over,
-- would silently drop the screening rule. Re-emitted in full because the
-- function is one plpgsql block, so changing a rule is a rewrite rather than a
-- patch; the signature is unchanged, so `create or replace` is enough and the
-- pg_cron entry (20260905140000) keeps resolving to this one.

  -- N, part one (#1296). Website accounts, decided and applied once for the

  --
  -- The second rule with nothing to scope, for a stronger reason than rule H's:
  -- an account has no tenant until a claim is approved. Somebody signs up at
  -- /my against whichever host they were on and nothing records which --
  -- deliberately, because #1161 resolves a constituent's tenant from the
  -- request rather than from a membership. There is no tenant whose sweep owns
  -- the row.
  --
  -- Two consequences, both the conservative direction:
  --
  --   * the clock is the SHORTEST any tenant has set, as rule H's is. An
  --     account belongs to a person rather than to an organization, so no
  --     tenant's choice may extend how long another's sign-up is held.
  --   * it enforces only where EVERY active tenant has the rule enforcing. One
  --     organization that has not agreed to the period is a veto, because the
  --     row it would remove is as much the next organization's as its own. A
  --     tenant with no row at all reads as 'off' and vetoes too.
  --
  -- The candidate list is read whatever the modes say, so a dry run reports
  -- real counts. It is read here rather than after the loop, so rules L and M
  -- below have not yet dropped this run's expired claims: an account those
  -- deletions free is deleted by the next night's run, not this one. The same
  -- conservatism rule D2 records, and for the same reason -- reporting the
  -- accounts that are already free is checkable, and simulating the ones a
  -- later rule in the same run would free is not.
  --
  -- In its own exception block, unlike rule H's call, which is bare: this one
  -- deletes from auth.users, where a reference the walk cannot see (an
  -- extension's table, storage.objects.owner) raises 23503. The sweep has to
  -- survive that and report it, which is what v_account_error carries into
  -- every tenant's run below.
