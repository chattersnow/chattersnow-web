-- #1259: ask a registrant whether they have been to one of our events before.
--
-- Two readers want this. The organizer wants to know who to look after on the
-- day. A claim reviewer (§5.23) wants the one piece of evidence that helps most
-- when an email matches nobody -- "I came to the November swap" is a record to
-- go and look for.
--
-- It does NOT replace the derived figure. First-time versus returning is
-- already computed from check-ins, in computeFirstTimeParticipants()
-- (programs/reports/impact-rollup.ts), get_event_impact_derived_data and the
-- People segment counts, and those stay exactly as they are. A self-reported
-- answer and an attendance record are different facts: the first is what
-- somebody says about themselves before the event, the second is what the
-- ledger saw. The impact numbers that reach an annual report must keep coming
-- from the ledger, so this column is stored beside them and never merged into
-- them.
--
-- Not a tenant-scoped migration: it adds a platform column and replaces two
-- platform functions, and seeds no rows into a tenant table (docs/tenants.md,
-- "Writing migrations on a multi-tenant database").

  'Self-reported at registration (#1259): has this person been to one of our events before? Null means the question was not answered, which is not "no" -- nothing may treat it as one.

-- The anonymous path
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The question is asked of EVERY anonymous registrant, identically, whatever
-- the directory holds. A question that appeared only for addresses matching no
-- `people` row would tell the reader whether the organization has a record of
-- them, which is exactly the enumeration answer §5.23's claim flow refuses to
-- give. The cost of asking somebody we already know is one redundant question;
-- the cost of asking selectively is an oracle. Nothing below branches on
-- whether resolve_or_create_person_by_email() matched or minted.
--
-- Adding a trailing parameter changes the signature, so this drops before
-- recreating (see 20260826190000's note). The body is otherwise unchanged from
-- 20260916160000.
