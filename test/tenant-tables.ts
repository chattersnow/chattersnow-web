/**
 * Every table that carries a `tenant_id` (#707 Phase 2, 20260906010000) --
 * the tables given the column with a default, plus the three that take it
 * from their role by trigger, plus the three retention tables Phase 5b scoped
 * (20260906160000), plus `tenant_modules` (#900), which is the one with no
 * default on the column at all: nothing a session writes goes there.
 *
 * `audit_log` is deliberately absent: its `tenant_id` is nullable, and its
 * select policy admits rows with no tenant on purpose. It is covered by its
 * own case in the isolation suite.
 *
 * `content_pack_adoptions` (#895) is absent for a different reason: a row in it
 * exists only once one tenant has copied another tenant's pack, so a database
 * with a single seeded tenant has none by construction and the per-table check
 * below -- which requires rows in tenant A -- would be asserting against an
 * empty table. Seeding one would mean seeding a row the application cannot
 * produce. Its isolation is covered directly in
 * `src/app/portal/(app)/administration/site-content/articles/packs/actions.integration.test.ts`,
 * which provisions the second tenant that makes adoption possible at all.
 *
 * `person_waiver_acceptances` (#1401) is absent for the same reason: a row
 * exists only once a linked person accepts a waiver the tenant has adopted,
 * and the seed adopts none. Nothing but two SECURITY DEFINER functions can
 * read it at all -- it has no policies and no grants -- which
 * `src/lib/constituent/actions.integration.test.ts` asserts directly.
 *
 * `event_registration_options` and `event_registration_option_counts` (#1407)
 * are absent for the same reason: the seed gives no event a registration
 * question, and one given to a seeded event would make every suite that
 * registers for it answer. Their isolation is asserted by the host probe on
 * `public_event_registration_options` in the isolation suite and directly in
 * `src/lib/registration-options.integration.test.ts`.
 *
 * A table added later with a `tenant_id` column belongs here too. The catalog
 * side of that -- its policies carrying the tenant predicate, its foreign
 * keys being composite -- is asserted by `tenant_isolation_gaps()` regardless
 * of this list; this list is what drives the behavioural per-table checks.
