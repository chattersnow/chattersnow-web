# Learn module content audit

Resolves the "define scope" blocker in `chattersnow-web#361`. Maps epic `chattersnow-web#256`'s proposed IA, priority order, and legal-risk tiers into a concrete per-category article list for the 7 categories that currently render the "Articles for this category are coming soon." placeholder in `src/app/(public)/learn/[slug]/page.tsx`. `park-riding-safety` is excluded — it already has content, shipped via the later, separately-scoped epic `chattersnow-web#269`, and was never part of #256's original 7-category IA.

Authors: follow `docs/learn-content-guidelines.md` for tone, per-topic risk rules, and the required per-article disclaimer.

Implementation pattern to replicate per category (already shipped for `park-riding-safety`): a `{category}-data.ts` typed article array + a `{category}-sections.tsx` renderer built on the shared `LearnSection`/`LearnDisclaimer` components (`src/app/(public)/learn/learn-section.tsx`), registered via two-line additions to the `CATEGORY_CONTENT`/`CATEGORY_NAV` maps in `src/app/(public)/learn/[slug]/page.tsx`. See `src/app/(public)/learn/park-riding-safety/park-riding-safety-data.ts` and `park-riding-safety-sections.tsx` for the reference implementation.

Risk tiers (per `docs/learn-content-guidelines.md`): 🟢 low-risk. 🟡 needs care — explain the concept, defer specifics/settings/diagnoses to a qualified professional, and end with an appropriate disclaimer.

This is a working backlog, not a final content list — adjust as categories are implemented.
