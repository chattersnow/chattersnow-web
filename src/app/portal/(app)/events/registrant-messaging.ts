/**
 * What this queue calls the person, the record and the refusals when a
 * staffer writes to a registrant (#1317).
 *
 * A file of its own rather than constants in `registrants-actions.ts`, because
 * that module is `"use server"` and may export nothing but async functions --
 * and the sheet, which is a client component, needs the same sentences the
 * actions answer with. Everything that is not this queue's own wording is
 * shared in `@/lib/notifications/record-message`, which this file deliberately
 * does not import: that module is `server-only`, and reaching for its generic
 * `FAILED` here would drag it across the client boundary. The actions, which
 * are already on the server, use it directly.
