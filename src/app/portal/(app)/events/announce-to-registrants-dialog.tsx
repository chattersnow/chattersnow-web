 * One notice, to everybody registered for this event (#1317).
 *
 * The composer's own shape is the one-to-one dialog's, with one addition that
 * changes everything about it: an audience, and the resolved count of what
 * that audience comes to, stated before the send. The count is the part that
 * cannot be undone, so it is not a detail in the confirmation toast -- it is
 * on screen while the staffer is still deciding, and it accounts for every
 * registration that is not in it.
 *
 * The audience is resolved twice, here and in the action, from the same pure
 * function. That is deliberate: the browser's copy is what makes the count
 * honest, and the server's is what makes it safe -- this dialog sends an
 * audience *name*, never a recipient list, so it cannot be talked into mailing
 * anyone who is not registered.
