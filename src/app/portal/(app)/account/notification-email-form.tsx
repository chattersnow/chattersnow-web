 *
 * Sits above the switches rather than beside the preferred name, because it
 * answers the same question they do -- what reaches me, and where -- and
 * because leaving it with the identity fields invites reading it as a second
 * way to sign in.
 *
 * Three states, and the difference between them is the point: what is being
 * used, what has been asked for, and what happens if the link is never
 * followed. A save that reports "saved" and then quietly keeps sending
 * elsewhere would be the worst of the three to read.
