 * the ledger query a plain one-table read, which is what the tenant/created_at
 * index serves; an `!inner` embed would make the join decide the plan and the
 * sort.
 *
 * Both address columns are searched, because `notification_email` is where a
 * person's mail actually goes when they have set one (#1042) and is the more
 * likely thing to be pasted into this box from a provider's dashboard.
 *
