// The delivery log renders `notification_deliveries.kind` as a label, and the
// column is free text -- a sender can introduce a kind without a migration and
// without touching this route. This file is the thing that notices: it imports
// the kind constant of every sender that calls deliverEmail() and asserts each
// one reaches a written label rather than the humanized fallback.
//
// Three of those senders import "server-only", which throws outside Next's
// bundler, so it is mocked here. That is the whole reason
// delivery-log-labels.ts writes its seven unregistered keys as literals
// instead of importing them: the cost is paid once, in this file, rather than
// on the path of every module that parses a URL.
