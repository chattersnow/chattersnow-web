/**
 * What each `notification_deliveries.kind` is called on the delivery log
 * (#1310).
 *
 * `kind` is free text, not an enum, on purpose: adding a kind is a constant
 * and a sender, never a migration. That leaves nowhere central to read a label
 * from, so this module assembles one from the two registries that already hold
 * labels and fills the gap with a map of its own:
 *
 *   * `AUTO_REPLIES` first, because its labels are written as names of
 *     messages -- "Event registration confirmation" -- which is what a log row
 *     is.
 *   * `NOTIFICATION_KINDS` next, whose labels are written as names of
 *     *switches* -- "Daily task reminders" -- and read acceptably as a kind.
 *   * `UNREGISTERED_KIND_LABELS` for everything neither registry holds: the
 *     kinds that are correspondence rather than a subscription
 *     (`staff_message`), addressed to an inbox rather than a person
 *     (`ops_report`), or part of an account flow nobody can switch off.
 *
 * Those seven keys are written out as literals rather than imported from the
 * senders that define them, because three of those senders are `server-only`
 * and this module is on the path of a plain URL-parsing test. The spellings
 * are pinned against the real constants in delivery-log-labels.test.ts, which
 * pays the cost of that import once and in one place.

 * somebody outside the directory is named by what the send was, which is the

 *
 *   * `ops_report` always, because the recipients are an app_settings list of

 *   * the contact-message and artwork receipts when the sender's address
