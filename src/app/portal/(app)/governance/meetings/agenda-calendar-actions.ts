// The Community & Partnerships section's own rows (#1242), and the calendar
// reader the Marketing & Social section (#1243) shares with it.
//
// **One reader, parameterized by the section's source.** Both sections are
// `{kind: "calendar"}` with different category keys and item types, so the
// difference between them is data on the template row, not a second query.
// `listAgendaCalendarItemsAction` therefore takes the section's own
// `AgendaSectionSource` and answers for whichever section asked.
//
// The partnerships feed sits beside it because it is the other half of the
// same section: the Calendar holds the dated items, Governance → Partnerships
// holds the relationships, and a board asking "where are we with partners"
// wants both at once. Two reads, one section, and no third module file for
// four columns.
//
// Neither read is an error the caller has to act on. The content calendar is
// its own entitlement and a board member commonly holds governance at manage
// and the calendar at none; `unavailable` says which of the two happened so
// the section can put a quiet line where the rows would have been and keep
// its Discussion box, which is the part that has to work in the meeting.
