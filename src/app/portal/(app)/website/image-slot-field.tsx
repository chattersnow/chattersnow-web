/**
 * The control for an `image` slot: a picture, a file to upload, and the link
 * box for one that is already somewhere on the web.
 *
 * Upload came second (#921). The slot was a link box alone, which meant
 * setting one photo was six steps outside the app -- open Drive, find the
 * file, Share, change access to "Anyone with the link", Copy link, come back,
 * paste -- across forty-six slots, and three of those steps go wrong in ways
 * the app cannot see: a folder link is a valid URL that serves HTML, and an
 * unshared file resolves to a thumbnail that 403s for every visitor while
 * looking right to the person who pasted it.
 *
 * The link box stays, and is not the lesser half. A photo already on the web,
 * or already in Drive, should not have to be re-uploaded to be used, and every
 * Drive link stored today keeps working exactly as it did -- this adds a way
 * in, it migrates nothing.
 *
 * A blank box is `null`, the slot's default, so "Back to default", the dirty
 * check and the draft that reverts the slot all agree on what empty means.
 *
 * Nothing is drawn while the slot is empty -- there is no crop to judge, and a
 * hole under each of eight unset slots is how Get Involved got long the first
 * time (#792). The section says once what blank does.
 *
 * Once there is a photo the picture is the control, not a thumbnail beside one
 * (#1251): the crop is set by dragging it inside the frame the public site
 * will crop it to. The crop rides on the value as a `#crop=` fragment, so it
 * is an ordinary slot edit as far as the dirty check, the draft and publishing
 * are concerned -- and the link box shows the value without it, because a rect
 * no one can picture has no business being in a box people type in.
