 * the rows behind it -- `inventory_movements`, `gear_requests` -- are gated on
 * `inventory:view`. So a Recipient chip would be legible to every holder of
 * `people:view`, which the nav's own comment notes "is held by almost
 * everyone", while the distributions it describes would not be. The label
 * would leak more than the data.
 *
 * The wider reason is what a column does that a card does not. The Roles
 * column renders across a browsable, searchable directory, so a chip there
 * assembles a roster of aid recipients out of a list nobody asked for one
 * from -- the segment #1073 explicitly declined, arrived at from the side.
 * The aspect card discloses the same fact to a staffer who already has one
 * person's record open for a reason, which is the disclosure that was asked
 * for.

 * Recipient is still in `PERSON_ROLES`: the person form offers it, the admin
 * panel renames it, and the aspect registry keys its card on it. This list is
