/**
 * Entry point to the merge review for an arbitrary pair.
 *
 * The Duplicates queue only lists records that share an address, and once the
 * unique index is on (20260904190000) nothing can. The case that outlives it is
 * one person who signed up twice under two different addresses, which only a
 * human can spot -- so the merge has to be reachable from the record itself,
 * not just from the queue.
 *
 * A dialog on the Profile card rather than a card of its own (#1108). Merging
 * is a rare, deliberate, one-way act on the record this page is already about,
 * so it belongs with the record's other controls; as a card it took a column
 * slot on every visit, permanently, next to the things people came to read.
