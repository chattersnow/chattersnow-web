/**
 * The Give card at the top of the Donations page (#1389), rendered only once
 * a tenant has switched giving on and pasted a URL.
 *
 * Every button here points at `/support/donate` rather than at the provider,
 * so the configured URL is assembled server-side in exactly one place and the
 * route a printed card or a QR code carries is the same one this page uses --
 * a route nothing linked to is a route that rots.
 *
 * The tax note is the tenant's own sentence or nothing at all. The platform
 * says nothing about what a gift is worth at tax time, here or anywhere:
 * `support.giving_tax_note` ships empty and an organization whose exemption is
 * pending, one giving through a fiscal sponsor and one holding its own
 * determination letter each write a different true one (docs/legal-basis.md
 * rule 1).
