/**
 * Mints one-shot signed upload URLs, one pair per picked file.
 *
 * This is the only reason the public site touches the service-role client, and
 * it exists because there is no safe alternative. A 10 MB image cannot be
 * posted through a Server Action — Next caps the body at 1 MB by default and
 * Vercel at 4.5 MB — and an `anon` insert policy on `storage.objects` would be
 * an unauthenticated write faucet on the same project as production. So the
 * browser uploads directly, to a path this action chooses, with a token that
 * works once.
 *
 * `claim_artwork_upload_slots` runs first and does the load-bearing work: the
 * rate limit, the open-call check, and resolving the tenant from the request
 * host. Nothing the caller sent reaches a path — the tenant and event ids come
 * back from the RPC, and the two uuid segments are minted here.
