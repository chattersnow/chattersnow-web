/**
 * Registers the signed-in caller for an event as themselves (#1165).
 *
 * The difference from `registerForEventAction` is one the person never sees
 * and the directory always does: this one sends no name and no email, because
 * `register_myself_for_event()` reads the person from the session and the
 * request host. There is nothing to match on, so there is no duplicate
 * `people` row to create -- which is the single largest source of them.
 *
 * No honeypot field either. The anonymous form carries one because anyone can
 * post to it; this path costs an account and a staff-approved claim, and a
 * hidden input would be a control that only catches somebody who has already
 * been let in.
