 * the submission still goes through `registerForEventAction`, which matches or
 * mints a `people` row exactly as it does for a visitor with no session. The
 * point is narrower than that -- an account between signing up and having its
 * claim (#1162) approved was being asked to type an address the application
 * had already verified, and a typo there mints the duplicate #1165 removed.
 *
 * Everything it puts on screen is derivable from the caller's own session, and
 * that is the line: nothing here may differ according to whether the address
 * matches a directory record, because a form that behaved differently would
 * answer "do you have a record of this person?" for anybody who can make an
