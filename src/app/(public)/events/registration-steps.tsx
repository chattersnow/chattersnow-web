 * The frame both registration forms share (#1403, #1413): "About you", then
 * "This event", then "Review and agree" with the button in a bar pinned
 * beneath them.
 *
 * **Three steps at every width** (#1413). #1403 stepped on a phone only and
 * showed a wider screen one long page; a wider screen gets the same steps now,
 * so there is one flow to design, test and support rather than two, and the
 * button is only ever beside the summary and the agreement it acts on.
 *
 * **No URL per step**, for #1256's reason: "I am halfway through a form" is
 * not worth a history entry, and Back belongs to the page. The other steps
 * are `hidden` rather than unmounted, and the values live in the form's own
 * state either way, so going back and forth keeps everything typed.
 *
 * **Validation is done here, not by the browser** (`noValidate`). The browser
 * would refuse to submit over a required field on a hidden step and could not
 * show it, which is a button that silently does nothing. So "Next" checks the
 * step it leaves, submitting checks all of them, and an invalid field brings
 * its own step back into view before the browser's message is shown. A server
 * error does the same through `error.step`.
 *
 * **The pinned bar (#1404).** Opaque, full width, with a rule above it, so
 * what scrolls beneath is covered rather than half-visible. It is the last
 * child of the tall `FieldGroup`, which is what it travels within, so at full
 * scroll it settles into place below the last field and never covers one for
 * good. The fields carry a bottom scroll margin of the bar's height, so a
 * field that focus or a validation message scrolls into view lands above the
 * bar rather than beneath it.
