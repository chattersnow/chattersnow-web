 * cannot land on a second copy of somebody because they typed a different
 * address this time. They are shown, because a person is entitled to see which
 * name they are about to appear under, and changing either is a link to
 * `/my/details` -- where a name is saved and an address is confirmed before it
 * moves.
 *
 * The rest is about this one attendance and travels on the registration alone:
 * a phone number corrected here reaches the organizer of this event and does
 * not silently rewrite the record. The one exception is the riding answers
 * (#1415), which describe the person rather than this attendance: they start
 * from the record and are written back to it.
