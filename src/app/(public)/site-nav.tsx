/**
 * Shared box for the top-level items so a plain link and a dropdown trigger are
 * the same shape. `data-active:bg-transparent` is the important part: the base
 * NavigationMenuLink style sets `data-active:bg-muted/50` while the trigger has
 * no data-active rule at all, so an active plain link used to render a filled
 * pill that an active dropdown never got. The rainbow underline is the brand's
 * active signal -- this leaves it as the only one, on both kinds of item.
 * Links *inside* the dropdown panels keep the pill, where it reads correctly.

// The horizontal padding pays for the account control (#1175), which needs 52px
// in a header that had five to spare. Measured with every section visible and
// the browser at 1024: the nav is 651px at `px-2.5`, 615px at `px-2` and 584px
// at `px-1.5`, and the budget below wants it at 604px or less -- so `px-2` is
// not enough on its own and the tightest step is used for the one band that
// needs it. `xl` relaxes to `px-2`, where the container is 1152px wide and 615
// fits with the CTA and the widened control beside it.
//
// Only horizontal, and the nav is `hidden lg:block`, so this never touches a
// tap target: below `lg` these items are rows in the sheet instead. What it
// does narrow is the rainbow underline, which the item's own box draws -- it
// reads as tighter tracking rather than as a smaller control.

          numbers below were measured in a browser at each width with every
          section visible -- not derived. Re-measure and correct them when you

          the CTA stands down across `lg`..`xl` -- it does not fit -- and why
          the nav runs at its tightest padding there.

          At `xl` there is 1152px, the nav relaxes a step to 615, the CTA is
          back and the account control has widened to carry the name:
