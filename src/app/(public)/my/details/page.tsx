/**
 * Correcting your own contact details (#1164).
 *
 * A page of its own rather than a section of `/my`, on the rule
 * docs/portal-navigation.md states: keeping your record current is a different
 * job from reading what you have done, not a different view of it. The link
 * between them is the navigation.
 *
 * An account that is signed in but not yet linked to a record is sent back to
 * `/my`, which is where the claim form is. There is nothing to edit until a
 * staffer has approved the claim, and a form with no record behind it would
 * fail at the database with nothing useful to say.
 *
 * ## What a card means here
 *
 * The page carried four of them, one per group, and they were the same box
 * four times over -- while three of the four saved together on one button at
 * the foot of the page and the fourth had a button of its own. Identical
 * chrome over two different commits is the thing a reader cannot see past:
 * nothing on screen said what "Save" saved.
 *
 * So a card now means *this commits on its own*, and only the email block
 * qualifies -- an address changes when a link sent to it comes back, not when
 * a form is submitted. `ContactForm`'s three groups are plain sections under
 * their own legends, which is the structure #1181 established and the card
 * borders were only redrawing. The card sits last for the same reason:
 * everything above the Save button belongs to it.
