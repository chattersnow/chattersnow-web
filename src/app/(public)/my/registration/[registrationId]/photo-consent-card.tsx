/**
 * Asking not to be photographed, from your own registration (#599, #1376).
 *
 * **The direction is reversed.** #599 put a consent box here, because
 * registering asked a question and this is where the answer could be changed.
 * Registering no longer asks anything: it carries the agreement, and the
 * remedy is objection. So the primary action records an objection, and
 * withdrawing one is offered only once there is something to withdraw.
 *
 * **It is one of three routes and the only self-service one.** The other two
 * — telling an organizer, and emailing — are what `PHOTO_CONSENT_NOTICE` names
 * first, because `set_my_photo_consent()` resolves through
 * `my_constituent_person_id('events')` and so reaches only somebody who has
 * claimed an account. Most registrants have not. That is why this card is a
 * convenience rather than the mechanism, and why nothing anywhere says
 * "change it from your registration page" without qualifying it.
 *
 * It renders only where the organization publishes paragraphs. With none there
 * is nothing to object to, nothing was implied by registering, and
 * `set_my_photo_consent()` would refuse the write anyway — offering a control
 * that cannot be saved would be worse than offering none.
 *
 * The paragraphs are **today's** text, not the snapshot on the row: somebody
 * objecting is objecting to the words as they read now, and that is what the
 * RPC re-snapshots onto the row.
 *
 * A pair of buttons rather than a checkbox and a Save. A box that starts
 * unticked beside "photos are fine" is a consent control, and a consent
 * control is the thing this ticket removed.
