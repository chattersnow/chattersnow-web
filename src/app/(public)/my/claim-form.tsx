 * Both of the things this form can end in, said once and used twice (#1182).
 *
 * The form is a claim *and* an enrollment: `review_person_claim()` with no
 * candidate chosen inserts a `people` row from what was typed here. The staff
 * side has always said so out loud; the claimant side described only the
 * linking half, which left the other half a surprise.
 *
 * One exported constant because the intro and the confirmation have to keep
 * saying the same thing, and because the test pins the confirmation to it. A
 * later, well-meant edit that varied either by whether anything matched would
 * answer "is this person a donor here?" for anybody who cared to ask -- which
 * is the question this whole flow is built not to answer.

/**
 * Ask to be linked to an existing record (#1162).
 *
 * The two fieldsets are the honest version of what the matcher does.
 * `person_claim_candidates()` proposes people on three things: the address
 * GoTrue has verified for this account, the normalized Instagram handle, and
 * trigram similarity on the name. Only two of those are typed here, so only
 * two fields belong under "What we match on". The phone, the note and any
 * second email are evidence for whoever reviews it and nothing else -- the
 * query never reads them.
 *
 * The verified address is a read-only line rather than a prefilled input for
 * the same reason. Prefilling it implied that typing an address is what finds
 * you, when changing it changes nothing about who gets proposed.
 *
 * The legends say which fields do the matching without saying whether anything
 * matched, which is the line this screen has to hold: describing the mechanism
 * is safe, describing an outcome is not. Every string below is a constant or a
 * static literal, and the only thing that varies is whether the request is in
 * flight.
