/**
 * Markdown a person typed, rendered rather than shown raw (#1201).
 *
 * Minutes and agenda notes are written in plain `<textarea>`s, and notetakers
 * type Markdown conventions in them -- `- ` for a bullet, `**bold**` for
 * emphasis. Every governance surface displayed that verbatim with
 * `whitespace-pre-wrap`, so a finalized set of minutes read with literal
 * asterisks in it; `agenda-export.ts` already *emitted* Markdown for the
 * clipboard and nothing ever rendered it.
 *
 * **Secure by default, and kept that way.** `react-markdown` builds a React
 * element tree instead of setting `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so a `<script>`
 * or an `<img onerror=...>` typed into a note is text, not markup, and its
 * `defaultUrlTransform` already blocks `javascript:` hrefs. Adding
 * `rehype-raw` is what would reintroduce raw HTML -- and would then oblige us
 * to add `rehype-sanitize` and a schema to take it back out again. Don't. No
 * sanitiser dependency is needed as long as raw HTML stays off, which is the
 * whole reason this library was chosen over `marked` + `dompurify`.
 *
 * Styling is a handful of rules on `.markdown-text` in `globals.css` rather
 * than `@tailwindcss/typography`: one more dependency for six selectors is not
 * worth it in a 17-package runtime.

/**
 * What a note needs and nothing more. Anything else degrades to its text
 * (`unwrapDisallowed`), so a stray `# heading` in a note reads as words
 * instead of opening a heading level inside a card.
 *
 * `br` is on the list though the elements above it carry the meaning: a hard
 * line break is something the writer typed, and dropping it would silently
 * join two lines. It has no attributes and no children to carry anything else.
