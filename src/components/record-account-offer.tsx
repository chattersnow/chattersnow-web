 *
 *   * `sign-up` -- signed out. A link to `/my/sign-in` carrying this record,
 *     so that whatever the account costs (a password, a Google round trip, an
 *     email confirmation opened tomorrow) the claim is still waiting on the
 *     other side.
 *   * `claim` -- signed in with no record linked yet. One button, nothing to
 *     retype: the row already holds what they told us.
 *
 * A reader whose account is already linked is offered nothing at all, and does
 * not reach this component -- it is already on their record.
 *
 * One component for both records rather than one per surface, so that the two
 * promises cannot drift: `PROMISE` and `SENT` are the copy §5.23 constrains,
 * and only the noun changes.
