/**
 * The one "have you been before?" control (#1259), shared by the anonymous
 * registration form and the register-as-yourself form so the wording cannot
 * drift between them — and, more to the point, so neither can start asking it
 * differently from the other.
 *
 * A select with a placeholder rather than a required choice, the same shape
 * the rider-profile questions use: leaving it alone is the third state, and it
 * is stored as null rather than as "no". The question is optional and the
 * description says so, because a registration is already saved either way.
 *
 * Nothing about it varies with who is asking. It renders identically for a
 * visitor with no session, an account whose claim has not been approved, and
 * somebody linked to a directory record — a control that behaved differently
 * would tell the reader whether the organization has a record of them.
