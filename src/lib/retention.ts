/**
 * The published retention periods, in one place.
 *
 * These are a board decision, recorded in the planning repo at
 * `decisions/2026-09-02-personal-data-retention-and-privacy-policy.md`, amended
 * for the constituent area by
 * `decisions/2026-09-19-constituent-accounts-claims-and-self-logged-hours-retention.md`
 * (#1296). Change them there first, then here, then in the `retention_policies`
 * seed (`supabase/migrations/20260905090000_create_retention_policies.sql`, and
 * one migration per amendment since).
 *
 * This module is the single in-repo transcription of that decision. The public
 * privacy page renders `RETENTION` from it, and the purge reads its periods
 * from the `retention_policies` table -- an integration test asserts the two
 * agree, so the page cannot promise one clock while the job enforces another.
 * That test is the whole reason `period` is duplicated here rather than left to
 * the database: prose and enforcement drifting apart is exactly the failure
 * this ticket exists to fix.
 *
 * `period` is a Postgres interval literal so the comparison is string equality
 * against the seeded column, with no parsing on either side.
