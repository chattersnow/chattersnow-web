/**
 * The published contract (#813 Phase 3), generated rather than written.
 *
 * Every schema here is the object the handlers actually use --
 * `z.toJSONSchema()` over the same `src/lib/api/schemas.ts` a POST validates
 * against, and over the response schemas an integration test parses real
 * answers with. A document maintained separately from the code is a document
 * that is wrong within a month; this one cannot say a field exists that the
 * code does not have.
 *
 * The registry-driven parts carry that further: `/content`'s properties come
 * from `SITE_CONTENT_SLOTS`, and `/site`'s from the brand, page-visibility and
 * layout registries, so adding a slot (#888) changes the API and its
 * description in the same commit.
