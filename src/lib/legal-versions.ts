 * The read, kept out of `@/lib/legal-documents.ts` for the reason
 * `@/lib/legal-publication.ts` is: that module reaches the client bundle and
 * this must not.
 *
 * Every version stays readable, not only the newest. "Which version did I
 * agree to when I registered" is a question a person asks, and `audit_log`
 * answers it only for somebody with a database and a reason to open it -- so
 * each published version has an address, and the live document says which one
 * it is and links the rest.
 *
 * A tenant serving the platform's default document (#858) has no versions of
 * its own, and that is not a gap to paper over: the default is regenerated
 * from the live configuration on every request, so the honest thing to say is
 * when the *platform's* text last changed, which is `PLATFORM_LEGAL_LAST_UPDATED`
 * in `@/lib/legal-defaults.ts`. See `LegalVersionNotice`.
