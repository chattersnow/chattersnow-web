 * What the public site serves for a promotion's official rules (#1322).

 * The read, kept out of `@/lib/giveaway-rules.ts` for the reason
 * `@/lib/legal-publication.ts` is kept out of `@/lib/legal-documents.ts`: the
 * registry and the template reach the client bundle and this must not.
 *
 * Every version is readable, not only the newest. The rules in force when
 * somebody entered are what governs their entry, so an entrant has to be able
 * to find them after a correction -- and the rules themselves say so, in
 * "General conditions". A promotion with no published version has no page at
 * all and 404s, the same stance #859 takes on a legal document nobody adopted.
