/**
 * The domain the Supabase auth cookie is written to (#1161).
 *
 * One account works on both of a tenant's surfaces: an administrator signs in
 * at `portal.<apex>` and is already signed in at `www.<apex>/my`, where they
 * can register for an event as themselves (#1160). A cookie with no `Domain`
 * attribute is host-only, so without this the session simply is not sent to
 * the public host and "one account" silently becomes "signed out over there".
 *
 * ## Why the apex list decides it, and not a rule about the hostname
 *
 * Deriving a parent domain by counting labels is wrong on every multi-label
 * suffix -- `.co.uk`, and `.vercel.app`, which is on the public suffix list and
 * would have every preview deployment trying to write a cookie the browser
 * rejects. The operator has already told us which apexes span several hosts:
 * `PORTAL_REDIRECT_HOSTS` exists because only the owner of a domain can
 * promise that `portal.<apex>` resolves here, and that promise is exactly the
 * statement that the apex, `www.` and `portal.` are one tenant's three names.
 * The same fact answers both questions, so it is read once rather than
 * restated in a second list that could disagree with the first.
 *
 * ## Only those three names
 *
 * A host that merely *ends with* a listed apex does not qualify. `uat` is a
 * real deployment on `uat.chattersnow.org`, and a `.chattersnow.org` cookie
 * written there would collide with production's by name -- signing into uat
 * would overwrite the session on `www`, in both directions. Preview hosts stay
 * host-only, which is correct for them anyway: they serve both surfaces from
 * one host, so nothing needs to cross.
 *
 * ## The single-host tenants must not get one
 *
 * The demo tenant serves its portal at `demo.rickiecruz.com/portal`, on the
 * same host as its public site, so it needs no shared cookie -- and giving it
 * one would put the session on `.rickiecruz.com`, which is also the platform
 * tenant's domain and the user's own consulting site. The platform tenant
 * (`portal.rickiecruz.com`) has no public site at all. Neither apex is listed,
 * so neither gets a domain, which is both the safe answer and the correct one.
 *
 * ## Both bundles must agree
 *
 * The browser client writes this cookie too (`signInWithPassword` on the login
 * form), so if the server scoped it to `.apex` and the browser left it
 * host-only, the browser would hold two cookies of the same name and send both
 * -- the failure this is meant to prevent, in a harder-to-see form. That is why
 * this reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_REDIRECT_HOSTS` and never the server-only
 * `PORTAL_REDIRECT_HOSTS`: a value only one side can see is a value the two
 * sides can disagree about. Unset means `undefined` on both sides, which is
 * exactly the host-only behaviour that shipped before this change.
