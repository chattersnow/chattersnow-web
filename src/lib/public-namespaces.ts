/**
 * The `app_settings` and `site_content` key namespaces that `anon` can read
 * (#888).
 *
 * Five of the views serving the public site match a key **prefix** rather than
 * an enumerated list of keys -- `public_branding` over `brand.%`,
 * `public_page_visibility` over `page_visibility.%`, `public_site_layout` over
 * `layout.%`, `public_legal_publication` over `legal_publication.%`, and
 * `public_site_images` over `site_images.%`. That is deliberate: which slots
 * exist is decided by the TypeScript registries below rather than by a
 * migration, so adding one is a registry entry and not a schema change.
 *
 * The cost of that convenience is that **any row inserted under one of those
 * prefixes becomes world-readable the moment it exists** -- no migration to the
 * view, no review of the public surface, no signal anywhere. Every key under
 * them today is legitimately public; the risk is the next one, since
 * `brand.` and `layout.` are generic enough that a `brand.internal_notes` or a
 * `layout.admin_only_flag` is a plausible thing for a future migration to add.
 *
 * So the prefixes are **reserved**: nothing that is not meant for `anon` may be
 * stored under them. The same holds one level up for `site_content`, which
 * `public_site_content` exposes with no prefix filter at all -- the table *is*
 * the public site's copy, and drafts are protected by the view's column list
 * (`draft_value` is simply not selected) rather than by a predicate. Nothing
 * non-public may ever be stored in `site_content` either.
 *
 * The database cannot see the registries, so it cannot tell a registered slot
 * from a typo or from a secret. This module is what lets a test do it instead:
 * `test/public-namespaces.integration.test.ts` reads every key out of both
 * tables and fails on one no registry knows about. The day a genuinely
 * non-public setting has to live under one of these prefixes, the answer is to
 * enumerate the keys in SQL rather than to relax this rule.
