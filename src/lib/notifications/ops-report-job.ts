/**
 * The daily leadership ops report run (#743): read, gate, shape, record, send.
 *
 * Same division of labour as task-digest-job.ts -- the route is the doorman,
 * this is the job, and the rules about what belongs in the report live in the
 * pure ops-report.ts next door. Runs on the service-role client, which
 * bypasses RLS: every query below names tenant_id explicitly, and that is the
 * only thing keeping one organization's operating picture out of another's
 * inbox. There is no policy underneath to catch a mistake.
 *
 * Unlike the digest, the recipient list starts the run rather than falling out
 * of it: the tenants worth doing any work for are exactly the ones with a
 * configured `notifications.ops_report_recipients`.
 *
 * Since #903 the counts are also filtered by the recipient tenant's module
 * entitlements. Nothing else here needed it -- the recipients come from
 * `people_with_permission()`, which #900 already gates -- but the counts do
 * not go through a permission at all, so a tenant with Finance off was still
 * being told how many expense approvals were waiting on nobody.
