/**
 * One event as an iCalendar file, for the registration confirmation to attach
 * (#1068). A registration is a commitment to be somewhere at a time, and the
 * useful thing to do with one is put it on a calendar.
 *
 * A hand-rolled builder rather than a dependency: RFC 5545 is large, but the
 * subset a single published VEVENT needs is small and every part of it is
 * asserted in the test beside this file. What the rest of this module is about
 * is the handful of details that mail clients are unforgiving about.
 *
 * METHOD:PUBLISH, with no ORGANIZER and no ATTENDEE. This is "here is an event
 * you can add", not an invitation: the registration *is* the RSVP, it is
 * already recorded, and a METHOD:REQUEST would put an Accept/Decline prompt in
 * front of the recipient whose answer nothing in this application reads.
 *
 * Times go out in UTC, which is the one place in this codebase that is right
 * rather than the event's own zone (contrast the email body, which reads in
 * `events.timezone` per #1057). A calendar client converts a UTC instant into
 * whatever zone the reader is in, which is what someone travelling to the event
 * actually wants; a zoned or floating time would need a VTIMEZONE block
 * carrying that zone's whole DST history to mean anything.
