/**
 * The paper every outbound email is printed on (#1238): the tenant's logo, its
 * colours, and the table scaffolding that survives a mail client.
 *
 * Before this, each renderer in this directory opened with its own copy of the
 * same `<div style="font-family: ...; max-width: 560px;">` and linked in the
 * same literal `#4c1d95` -- Chatter Snow's purple, sent from every tenant on
 * the platform. A tenant could upload a logo, pick a palette, see all of it on
 * its public site and its portal, and then the confirmation its registrants
 * actually received looked like nobody's organization at all.
 *
 * Three rules this file exists to hold:
 *
 *   * **Nothing may exist only inside the image.** Most clients block remote
 *     images by default, so the header has to read correctly with every image
 *     off: a tenant with no logo gets its name as a text wordmark, and a
 *     tenant with one gets that name as the image's `alt`, styled so the
 *     blocked state still reads as a wordmark rather than as grey system text.
 *     The footer names the organization either way.
 *   * **Email HTML is not web HTML.** Tables, inline styles, no stylesheet, no
 *     web font, no flex and no grid: Outlook on Windows renders through Word.
 *     Typography is deliberately not a brand token here (#1260) -- a web font
 *     does not load in most mail clients, so a branded email carries the
 *     tenant's colours and its logo and not its typeface.
 *   * **A colour nobody can read is worse than the platform's.** A brand
 *     colour is picked to work as a page accent against a tinted background,
 *     and a pale one is unreadable as link text on white. Every colour below
 *     goes through a contrast floor and falls back rather than render.
 *
 * Pure, with no runtime imports, for the same reason the renderers it serves
 * are: the preview (#1236) reaches this file through them from a Server
 * Action, and the whole thing is unit-tested under `bun run test` with no
 * database and no mail provider in the way. The plain-text part of a message
 * never passes through here at all -- there is no logo in text/plain and there
 * never should be.
