/**
 * The words an organization uses for the things the platform lends (#896).
 *
 * "Gear" is one organization's vocabulary for the concept these tables call
 * inventory. Another reads the same rows and calls it a tool library, a
 * lending library, a pantry, an equipment room. Before this, a tenant could
 * rename the heading on `/gears/library` -- that heading is a `site_content`
 * slot -- and the navigation item directly above it still said "Gear", because
 * every other surface carried the word as a literal.
 *
 * So the handful of words that appear in navigation are data, on the same
 * keyed-row pattern as `BRAND_COLOR_TOKENS` in `src/lib/branding.ts`: the
 * registry below is the list of terms, a tenant stores the ones it wants under
 * `lexicon.<key>` in `app_settings`, and an unset term falls through to the
 * platform's own neutral word. No migration per term, and the admin surface is
 * the one that already exists for branding.
 *
 * **Resist growing this.** A lexicon with fifty terms is a translation system
 * nobody maintains, and every term added is one more thing a new tenant has to
 * fill in before its site reads as written rather than as configured. The
 * value is in the four words below, each of which is read by navigation that
 * no slot could reach; a fifth has to argue for itself.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* renamed by any of this: the internal identifiers.
 * The `gears` visibility slot key, the `gears.*` content slot keys, the
 * `inventory` permission resource, the tables and their columns are names the
 * code calls things, not names a visitor reads, and renaming them is a data
 * migration for no user-visible gain.
 *
 * This module is imported by client components -- the portal sidebar renames
 * itself from it -- so it holds the registry, the pure resolution and the
 * host-resolved read only. The session-resolved and service-role reads live in
 * `src/lib/tenant-lexicon.ts`, the same split branding makes.
