/**
 * What a tenant's site actually collects, as the legal documents describe it
 * (#1291).
 *
 * `platformLegalDocument()` used to publish, as fact, that every site running
 * this application takes volunteer applications, event registrations, rider
 * profiles, gear requests, artwork submissions and contact messages. A tenant
 * running a contact form and nothing else published all six under its own name,
 * hedged by one sentence saying some of the forms above may not exist. That is
 * an honest dodge rather than an accurate policy, and the privacy policy is the
 * one document #859 keeps served for every tenant whatever else it has adopted.
 *
 * The signal was already computed: the switch the board set
 * (`page_visibility.*`) and the module entitlement the platform sold
 * (`public_tenant_modules`), both of which the public layout reads on every
 * request anyway.
 *
 * This is a named record rather than the raw visibility map so the prose beside
 * it reads as prose: `org.surfaces.volunteerApplications`, not
 * `visibility["get-involved-volunteer"]`.
 *
 * It takes no dependency on `@/lib/page-visibility`, which reaches `cache()`,
 * `next/navigation` and the server Supabase client -- `site-content.ts` types a
 * field against `CollectionSurface` and is imported by client components. The
 * cost is that the slot and module behind each surface are named here rather
 * than read from `PUBLIC_PAGE_SLOTS`; `legal-surface.test.ts` holds the two
 * lists together.
