 * mentions the open calls switched on in June, and only the organization can
 * rewrite it.
 *

 * entirely -- "unknown" is not a finding, and counting it would have handed
 * every tenant that has ever published an alert on the day this shipped.
 *
 * Gated on `site_content:manage`, the same permission the editor checks, so
 * the reads behind it are skipped for the overwhelming majority of a tenant's
 * members -- this runs in the portal layout, on every portal page render.
 *
 * #1321 folded the other half of the same question in here rather than adding
 * a second item beside it. A document in force is either the tenant's own text,
 * which can stop describing the site, or the platform's, which cannot drift but
 * can have gone unread or been rewritten underneath them; the administrator's
 * job in both cases is to open the document and read it, and one item saying
 * "two legal documents to review" is the honest count of that job. Two items,
 * one per mechanism, would have made the portal's plumbing the organizing
 * principle of its own nag list. The two sets cannot overlap -- see
 * `getLegalAcknowledgementState` -- so the counts simply add.
