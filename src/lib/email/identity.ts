/**
 * Who a tenant's mail comes from, where a reply to it goes (#857), and which
 * origin its links point at (#860).
 *
 * Outbound mail used to be multi-tenant on the recipient side and
 * single-tenant on the sender side: sendEmail() read EMAIL_FROM and
 * EMAIL_REPLY_TO off the environment and had no tenant input at all, so a
 * digest for one organization arrived from another's address and a reply
 * landed in another's inbox. The Reply-To is the sharper half -- the mailboxes
 * people read are on Zoho while the app sends through Resend, so a reply to
 * the sending address bounces, which is the whole reason EMAIL_REPLY_TO
 * exists.
 *
 * The origin is here rather than in a module of its own because it is answered
 * by a column this file already reads: tenants.custom_domain decides both
 * whether a tenant may send from its own address and which site its recipients
 * should be sent to. Two readers would mean two queries per tenant per run for
 * one row.
 *
 * Split the way ops-report.ts and ops-report-job.ts are: everything above
 * tenantMailContext() is pure, so the precedence rules and the header
 * composition are unit-testable without a database, and the one function that
 * touches Postgres does nothing but two reads. No `server-only`: this reads no
 * secret, the same as src/lib/notifications/settings.ts, and staying importable
 * keeps its test free of the mock.module dance send.test.ts needs.

 *     parent implies control of a child, so this half *is* a suffix match --
 *     but only in that direction, since anyone can be handed a subdomain.
 *
 * Without the second condition the first is not a control at all: once one
 * tenant's domain is verified, any other tenant's administrator could point
 * `notifications.from_address` at an address on it and send DKIM-signed mail as
 * them. `custom_domain` is writable only through platform_set_tenant_domain(),
 * behind require_platform_operator(), and the tenants update policy grants
 * `authenticated` the `name` column alone -- so a tenant administrator cannot
 * self-assign another tenant's domain, which is what makes this hold.
 *
 * Enforced here, at send time, rather than only where the setting is saved:
 * updateAppSettingAction() takes a free-form key, so any holder of
 * `system_settings:manage` can write this row without going through the panel's
 * validation. The action validates too, for the error message; this is the
