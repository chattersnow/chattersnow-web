 * 2. A `<style>` block is an injection surface. The colours are validated as
 *    six-digit hex before they reach it, and this gets the equivalent:
 *    membership in the registry, checked here, with an unknown key resolving to
 *    null and reaching no stylesheet at all. Nothing a tenant stored is ever
 *    interpolated -- what `brandingCss()` emits is the `cssVar` below, which
