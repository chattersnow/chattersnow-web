/**
 * The documents a tenant that has published none of its own is served (#858).
 *
 * These used to be Chatter Snow's, rendered from JSX and described in the
 * editor as "the platform's document": provisioning a tenant published another
 * organization's legal position, complete with snow-sports risk, a gear library
 * and New Jersey governing law, under the new tenant's brand. Chatter Snow's
 * documents are now its own tenant's published rows, and what is left here is
 * what the platform can honestly say for *any* nonprofit running *this*
 * application.
 *
 * Three rules held while writing them, and are worth holding to:
 *
 *   1. **Only what the software does.** Every factual claim below is about
 *      behaviour in this repository -- the forms that exist, the retention job
 *      that runs, the providers the deployment uses. Where only the
 *      organization can answer (its governing law, its charitable status, the
 *      risks its activities carry), the section is absent rather than vague.
 *   2. **No commitments on a tenant's behalf.** Numbers a tenant has not agreed
 *      to -- "we acknowledge within 5 days", "two board members review it" --
 *      are the same hazard as borrowed terms, so the process is described
 *      without them. Chatter Snow's own document keeps its board's numbers,
 *      because its board agreed to them.
 *   3. **No links to routes that may not exist.** Every public page except the
 *      legal ones can be hidden per tenant (`page_visibility.*`), so these
 *      documents name the forms they describe rather than linking to them. The
 *      exceptions are /privacy, which #859 keeps served for every tenant, and a
 *      #fragment, which stays inside the document it is written in.
 *   4. **Only what *this tenant's* software does** (#1291). Rule 1 was read too
 *      narrowly at first: the prose described every form in the repository, so
 *      a tenant running a contact form and nothing else published a policy
 *      about volunteer applications, rider profiles, gear requests and open
 *      calls, hedged by one sentence admitting some of them might not exist.
 *      A bullet, a retention row or a whole section that belongs to a
 *      collection surface now names it -- `CollectionSurface` in
 *      `@/lib/legal-surface` -- and drops out when that surface is off.
 *
 * This is a starting point for an organization's own counsel to rewrite, not
 * legal advice, and the Site Content editor says so where the slot is edited.

/**
 * The accessibility statement (#1368).
 *
 * The one document here whose factual claims are about this repository's own
 * testing, which makes rule 1 unusually easy to satisfy and unusually easy to
 * get wrong in the flattering direction. Two things are load-bearing and have
 * to survive any edit:
 *
 *   * **The conformance claim is partial, and the basis is stated.** An
 *     automated check finds a minority of the barriers on a page, and no full
 *     manual screen-reader pass has been done across the site --
 *     `docs/a11y-scan-findings.md` says so in its own words. "Aims to meet
 *     WCAG 2.2 AA", with no basis given, is the same overclaim in nicer
 *     clothes. Overclaiming conformance to a disabled reader is not a neutral
 *     error.
 *   * **It is scoped to the public website, explicitly rather than by
 *     silence.** Every entry in `e2e/a11y-baseline.json` today is a portal
 *     route, and a reader left to assume the wider reading would be reading a
 *     claim nobody made. `legal-defaults.test.ts` holds the two sentences that
 *     depend on that being true, so a public route joining the baseline fails a
 *     test rather than leaving a false statement published.
 *
 * Three things only the organization can answer -- who to contact, what it
 * commits to when it is told, and whether its own events and venues are
 * accessible. So the prose carries no response time and no promise a tenant has
 * not made, and the Site Content slot description is what names those as the
 * parts to replace.
