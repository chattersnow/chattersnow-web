/**
 * The content model for the public site (#707 Phase 4).
 *
 * Every piece of organization-specific copy on the public site is a *slot*:
 * a key, a page it belongs to, a type, and a default. A tenant with no
 * `site_content` rows renders those defaults, and a provisioned tenant starts
 * from a complete site it rewrites slot by slot from Administration > Site
 * Content rather than from a blank page.
 *
 * The defaults used to be Chatter Snow's copy, because this registry was
 * extracted from its pages. That made a newly provisioned nonprofit's public
 * site another organization's -- its headline, its mission, and, in
 * `about_team.members`, real people's names and biographies. Provisioning
 * deliberately copies no site content, and `org`, `home`, `contact` and
 * `events` carry no visibility gate, so that was public from the moment the
 * tenant existed. Chatter Snow now holds its copy in its own rows (#795
 * rollout step 3) and the defaults are prompts: they read as unwritten, which
 * is the honest thing for a site nobody has written yet to look like.
 *
 * The four pages the platform wrote about itself are the deliberate exception,
 * and the reason is narrow: their slots describe the *platform* rather than the
 * organization, and their routes are hidden for every tenant until somebody
 * turns them on. A default that speaks for the platform is the platform's own
 * to write. It still names no product and no company -- see the block above
 * those slots. They are the two audience paths (#1328), the module tour
 * (#1329) and the price list (#1330).
 *
 * The exception stops at anything only *this deployment* knows. A destination
 * is a host and a price is a commercial term, so `*.ctas`, `pricing.plans`'
 * figures and the onboarding fee are the platform tenant's own rows
 * (20260920030000 and its predecessor) rather than defaults every operator
 * would inherit -- see the comment over `pricing.plans`.
 *
 * Only the slots that *named or described* an organization were rewritten.
 * "Get in touch" and "Meet the team" are product chrome that happens to live
 * in a slot -- every organization has a contact page and a team -- and
 * replacing them with prompts would make an unwritten site worse rather than
 * more neutral.
 *
 * "Gear library" was filed under that heading too, and that was the wrong line
 * (#896). It is not chrome: it names *what the organization lends*, which is
 * exactly the thing that differs between tenants. So a default may carry a
 * `{term}` placeholder from the lexicon registry in `src/lib/lexicon.ts`, and
 * `resolveSiteContent` resolves it against the tenant's own words -- an
 * organization that has said it runs a tool library does not then have to
 * retype every heading that contains the word. Placeholders are resolved in
 * *defaults only*: a stored value is the tenant's own writing, and a brace in
 * it is a brace they typed.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* a slot: the sizing tables (Chatter Snow's, gated
 * to that tenant by #831), the form labels and validation messages (product
 * chrome), and the structure of the pages themselves. The legal documents are
 * a special case -- see `document` below.
 *
 * The Learn guides were on that list until #894, described as "generic
 * snow-sports material any organization can publish as-is". That did not hold:
 * `mountain-basics` and `park-riding-safety` are generic *within snow sports*,
 * and this is not a snow-sports platform. They are now a collection of their
 * own -- `article_categories` and `articles`, modelled in
 * `src/lib/articles.ts` -- because a registry of fixed keys cannot hold an
 * unbounded number of rows a tenant creates.
 *
 * The photos are slots too (#812): an `image` slot is the picture that sits
 * beside a section's copy, keyed `site_images.<slot>` and stored in the same
 * table, so it is drafted, published and reverted exactly as the words are.
 * Its default is always null -- the placeholder icon -- and the public site
 * reads them through `getSiteImageUrls()` in `src/lib/site-images.ts`, which
 * strips the prefix; `about_team.members`' `photo_slot` field names the short
 * form for the same reason.
 *
 * This module is imported by the editor, a client component, so it stays
 * free of server-only imports; the database read lives in
 * `src/lib/public-site.ts`.

  // typed into Administration -> Site Content by whoever sets prices, takes
  // effect without a deploy, and changes again next quarter without a pull
  // request.
  //
  // **What the defaults below do and do not say.** The *shape* of the price
  // list is the platform's own decision and is written here: three sizes, every
  // module on every plan, sized by how many people need a login rather than by
  // which parts of the system you may use. The *figures* are this deployment's
  // commercial terms -- another operator running this code charges its own --
  // so every default price is an em dash, and the platform tenant's real
  // numbers are its own `site_content` rows (20260920030000). The `pricing`
  // visibility slot stays off until somebody has agreed to them.
