/**
 * The public site's photos, as the pages read them.
 *
 * Every admin-editable image on the site is an `image` slot in the content
 * registry (`src/lib/site-content.ts`, keyed `site_images.<slot>`), edited
 * beside the copy it accompanies at Website > Pages and stored
 * in `site_content` like any other slot (#812). The `public_site_images` view
 * serves the published rows with the prefix stripped, so a page looks its
 * photo up by the short name: `urls.about_story_photo`.
 *
 * Adding a slot is one registry entry plus a `getSiteImageUrls()` read on the
 * page that shows it -- no migration, and the view never changes.
